/**
Recursion: Martin & The Dragon
Once upon a time, Martin found himself face-to-face with an imposing dragon. Desperately, he asked:

Martin: “Excuse me, Mr. Dragon, are any of these numbers odd?”
(He held out a list: 3142, 5798, 6550, 5914.)

The dragon, looking bored and slightly annoyed, replied:
Dragon: “I’ll only tell you if the first number is odd.”

Martin: “But I need to know if any of the numbers in the list are odd!”
Dragon: “Sorry, I’ll only tell you about the first number.”

Martin thought for a moment, then responded:
Martin: “Fine... what about the first number in this list?”
(He pointed to 3142.)

Dragon: “Not odd.”
Martin: “Okay, then what about the first number in this new list?”
(5798, 6550, 5914.)

Dragon: “Not odd.”
Martin: “And this list?”
(6550, 5914.)

Dragon: “Still not odd.”
Martin: “And this?”
(5914.)

Dragon: “Not odd.”

Finally, Martin showed the dragon an empty list.
Martin: “Now what about this list?”
Dragon: “That’s an empty list, you fool! There’s no number to check!”
Martin: “Aha! So all the numbers must be even!”
Dragon: “I never said that…”

As Martin walked away, he realized:
Martin: “Wait… this whole thing was recursion!”
